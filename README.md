# Completionist

I've never found a calendar or to-do list app that I stuck with. I have a list of very simple requirements, but every app I've used is either too complex or too simple. 

This application will combine a to-do list app with a calendar one, and hopefully be the app I've been looking for all these years.

Please remember this is an app I am building for myself, therefore I am making litle effort at this stage to add customisability to appeal to a wider audienc - but if it goes well then I may do this.

## The key requirements are as follows:

### Calendar app
- 3 clearly defined categories for 'events'
    - Life stuff (birthdays, holidays, big events)
    - Entertainment stuff (film/tv releases, new music, sporting events)
    - Uni stuff (exams, deadlines, meetings)

### To-do app
- Theoretically unlimited number of categories
- Ability to tie dates to tasks
    - Different types of date (e.g. hard deadline, soft deadline, date ranges)
    - Automatically show up on calendar

### Both
- Simple interface
    - Easy to read and understand
    - Easy to add new items
- Clear separation of different categories
